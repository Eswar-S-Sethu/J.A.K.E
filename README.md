A voice assistant in Python 

Hello people, I'm working on a voice assistant in Python programming language. This one is being programmed to run in the background continuously and listen to the wake words while it's up. It's only meant
for Linux-based systems like Ubuntu but if this is successful, it'll be released for more platforms like Windows and macOS. JAKE stands for Just Another Kind of Evolution. It will be released in different
versions. Each version is better than the last. 

Current version features:
1. Basic voice recognition
2. Turn off, restart, and suspend the computer on command
3. Get word meanings and more from a dictionary
4. do a Google search and respond to a query
5. do a youtube search
6. fetch info from Wikipedia
7. fetch daily news
8. tell the date and time
9. tell me if there's an event on the calendar
10. check emails and see if there are unread emails
11. record a voice
12. change formats
13. play tunes on Spotify
14. automate gui actions
15. automate keyboard shortcuts
16. disable talkback
17. say something about itself
18. control screen brightness
19. control volume or mute speakers
20. turn wifi and Bluetooth on or off
21. offline speech recognition
22. set reminders
23. take notes
24. answer FAQs about the voice assistant
25. Greets the user when booting up. Based on timings and booting-up times, the greetings will be different.
